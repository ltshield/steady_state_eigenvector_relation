# steady_state_eigenvector_relation
A jupyter notebook tutorial intended to refresh the reader's memory on eigenvectors/eigenvalues and introduces them to their relationship to a network's steady state distribution when dealing with a Markov adjacency matrix.

To see the actual visualizations or to run/modify the code to improve the learning process, feel free to download the file and to do so in your personal IDE!
